This article is about general cache algorithms. For detailed algorithms specific to paging, see page replacement algorithm. For detailed algorithms specific to the cache between a CPU and RAM, see CPU cache.
Not to be confused with cache placement policies.
In computing, cache replacement policies (also known as cache replacement algorithms or cache algorithms) are optimizing instructions or algorithms which a computer program or hardware-maintained structure can utilize to manage a cache of information. Caching improves performance by keeping recent or often-used data items in memory locations which are faster, or computationally cheaper to access, than normal memory stores. When the cache is full, the algorithm must choose which items to discard to make room for new data.
